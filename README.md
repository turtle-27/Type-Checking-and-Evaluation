    - This repo contains lexer, parser, evaluator and type checker for Boolean algebra using ML-Lex and ML-Yacc.
    - The executable should take the name of the file to be analyzed as a command-line argument.
    - The executable produce the output of the lexer followed by a newline, then the parserâ€™s output.
